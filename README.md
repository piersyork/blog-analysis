# Blog analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository stores the analysis and replication data for my personal blog at [piers.york@github.io](piers.york@github.io). Each project will have it's own readme file, outlining how the analysis was undertaken. Some projects will provide new data and documentation will be provided for this.
